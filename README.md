### Links

- Live Site URL: [QR Card](https://bdescalzo.github.io/qrcard-frontendmentor)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS properties
- (A bit of) Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project, I mainly practised what I already knew. However, it was specially useful to practice with centering elements.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to start creating real layouts, using Flex, Grid, media queries... for now, this is a good start!

### Useful resources

- [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48516538/flex-align-items-center-not-centering-items) Stack Overflow answer and [this](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_center-vertical.asp) W3Schools page were specially useful to center the card both vertically and horizontally.
